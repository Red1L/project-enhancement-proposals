A PEP is a description that allow to understand what the change is and what is the motivation 
behind it. It is a markdown file, always beginning with 3 informations:

* A numeric identifier, 
* A title,
* A status (draft, pending, accepted or refused). 

It is strongly recommended to follow the following layout for the PEP:

* Abstract,
* Motivation,

A PEP should always be associated with a pull request for discussion during the drafting of the
proposal.
